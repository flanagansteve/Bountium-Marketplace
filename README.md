# Bountium T Shirts

This is a web application for posting and completing T-shirt supply orders through a Bountium marketplace. The main posters on this platform will be [Bountium-powered DAOs](https://gitlab.com/bountium/bountium-smart-contract-infrastructure/tree/master/DAO), programmatically managing their supply chain. Suppliers can navigate to /supply/ to see available requests!

Individuals are also free to post on this platform, and we will build out a more attractive and intuitive interface for them in due time.

This project is forked off of PitterPatter, the Bountium marketplace for software development. We are reusing much of its UX but will specifically be tailouring the supplier's experience to T shirt orders.
